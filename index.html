            Originally, yoga was taught by one teacher directly to one student. The great ancient teachers understood the importance of individualizing each yoga experience to meet the needs of the student. Today, a private session allows for a more intimate view into your practice. You can start a new practice, deepen your practice or spend some time working with an injury or condition. When you work with a teacher one on one, the teacher is able to help you experience the benefits of yoga in a safe, personal way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Private Yoga is an invaluable tool for students of all levels and experience. Private lessons provide the perfect setting to address your goals and work on areas of individual interest. You can work with the teacher of your choice or we can match a teacher to meet your expressed needs. Private Yoga can help you deepen your practice, gain confidence, answer questions and provide guidance. Our teachers can develop a home practice tailored to your individual needs.

        <h2>Why take a private class?</h2>
          <h3>For new students</h3>
          <p>As a new student, you may be intimidated by the public classroom environment. Private classes allow instructors the opportunity to focus on you and make sure you are getting off to an appropriate start. </p>
          <h3>For more experienced students</h3>
          <p>Experienced students benefit from privates as well. You are able to have a deeper insight into specific postures or categories of postures that interest you. Private yoga sessions are the perfect learning environment. We can help you with posture alignment, modifications and can help you develop a balanced home practice. Private yoga classes can also give the experienced student time to learn about yoga philosophy or other aspects of interest, such as meditation and breathing practices.</p>
